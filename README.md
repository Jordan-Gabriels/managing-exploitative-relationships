# managing-exploitative-relationships
In recent years a literature has emerged showing that victims experience considerable distress when forgiving offenders that present an exploitation risk. In this article we show that this link between exploitation risk and distress is dependent upon the victim’s motivation for forgiving. In two studies (Study 1 using a prospective autobiographical recall design, Study 2 an experimental scenario method), the victim’s motivation for forgiving the offender moderated the relationship between exploitation risk and forgiveness-related distress such that, when forgiveness was motivated by self-concern, exploitation risk lead to relatively less distress than when it was motivated by relationship-concern.
